# My IT Journey: From Early School Interruption to Lifelong Learner

**Role / Context**: Self-motivated career changer in IT

## Situation
- Performed well in Computer Studies during secondary school (outstanding results in the subject during HKCEE / 中學會考).
- Left secondary school after Form 3 and paused formal education for three years.

- More than a decade later, decided to return to structured learning through ERB courses in Hong Kong.

## Task
- At both stages, the challenge was to rebuild foundational knowledge, regain academic confidence, and build a sustainable career in IT — building on an early interest in computing.

## Action
- **First Phase** (post-Form 3): Self-taught programming basics → reignited the early passion from Computer Studies → pursued and completed a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Electronic and Communication Engineering at City University of Hong Kong.
- **Second Phase** (recent years): Enrolled in ERB programming and IT courses → systematically practiced coding → explored career paths in IT support, application development, and solution consulting.

## Result
- Over more than ten years, programming and computing consistently served as the turning point that reshaped my education and professional direction.
- Demonstrated resilience, self-discipline, and commitment to lifelong learning.
- Transformed a non-linear background into a strength: early aptitude in IT + hands-on experience + formal qualifications + sustained passion.

**Key Takeaway**  
An early interest in computing, even interrupted, can become the foundation for long-term growth in IT when pursued with consistent effort.
